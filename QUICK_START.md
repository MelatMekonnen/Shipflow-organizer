# ShipFlow Organizer™️ — Quick Start Guide
This guide helps you deploy ShipFlow in a warehouse in under 10 minutes.
No new software. No system replacement.
## What ShipFlow Does
ShipFlow Organizer™️ improves *physical organization*, not digital systems.
It helps teams:
•⁠  ⁠Keep same shipment codes physically close
•⁠  ⁠Reduce walking distance
•⁠  ⁠Prevent staging chaos
•⁠  ⁠Protect CPT without extra labor
ShipFlow works alongside existing warehouse systems.
## Step 1 — Assign Codes to Lanes (2 minutes)
Open:
•⁠  ⁠Lane–Code Matrix template
Actions:
•⁠  ⁠Assign 2–3 shipment codes per lane
•⁠  ⁠Define max cart capacity per lane
•⁠  ⁠Assign primary and secondary staging areas
Rule:
Same codes should stay in the same lane group every shift.
## Step 2 — Map Staging Areas (2 minutes)
Open:
•⁠  ⁠Staging Area Map template
Actions:
•⁠  ⁠Group staging areas by lane group
•⁠  ⁠Mark distance to dock (Near / Mid / Far)
•⁠  ⁠Assign priority to CPT-sensitive areas
Rule:
High-priority CPT carts should never be staged far unless required.
## Step 3 — Control CPT Execution (2 minutes)
Open:
•⁠  ⁠CPT Priority Board
Actions:
•⁠  ⁠List shipments by CPT time
•⁠  ⁠Highlight critical shipments
•⁠  ⁠Assign action owner (DCM / TDR)
Rule:
The board shows what must move now — not everything at once.
## Step 4 — Manage Relocation (2 minutes)
Open:
•⁠  ⁠Relocation Control Sheet
Actions:
•⁠  ⁠Log all relocation movements
•⁠  ⁠Require a reason and approval
•⁠  ⁠Track cart count and status
Rule:
Relocation enforces structure — it does not fix chaos.
## Step 5 — Run One Shift (2 minutes)
Actions:
•⁠  ⁠Brief WebTO / Waterspider roles
•⁠  ⁠Enforce lane and staging discipline
•⁠  ⁠Observe walking distance and CPT performance

Most teams see improvement in the first shift.
## What ShipFlow Does NOT Replace
•⁠  ⁠CPT systems
•⁠  ⁠Scanners
•⁠  ⁠Yard management
•⁠  ⁠Dock management systems
ShipFlow organizes *how people move carts*, not how systems track them.
## Best Practices
•⁠  ⁠Keep lane assignments stable
•⁠  ⁠Limit codes per lane
•⁠  ⁠Do not overflow staging areas
•⁠  ⁠Use relocation only when necessary
## Support & Feedback
ShipFlow Organizer™️ is an open framework.
